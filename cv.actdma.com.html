Working with the children, teaching them to swim following a pre-defined curriculum (Laurie Lawrence Swim School, Level 1 to Level 3 Advanced.)

Many of my classes focused on beginner swimmers, often timid, sometimes with special needs.  I gain their trust, get them floating and then swimming.</p>

              I set up “Stay Safe Online” website which taught home users how to lock down their PC or MAC and protect their computer from being compromised.  Then I got a phone call from my former colleagues at the City of Port Phillip asking if I could come in and do some ‘short term’ project work for about two weeks. I accepted, but the two weeks turned into 10 months!  They didn’t want to let me go and had plenty of work.  I returned there after spending Winter of 2014 in Brisbane, and helped them out for another 6 months, before making the permanent move to Brisbane in mid-2015, where I qualified as a Children’s Swimming Instructor and began teaching children’s swimming lessons.<br>
